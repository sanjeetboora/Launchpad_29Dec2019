# Lecture 2 - Summary of Lecture!!

#### Data types
> What are data types?<br>
> What's the need of data types in C++?<br>
> Data types which we have in C++.<br>
> How we can calculate the ranges for different data types?<br>

---

#### Different Number systems
> Conversion from Decimal number system to Binary number system<br>
> Conversion from Binary number system to Decimal number system<br>

---

#### Data modifiers
> Data modifiers which we have in C++.<br>
> How we can calculate the modified ranges when we use data modifiers?<br>
> How the negative numbers are stored?<br>
> -> In 2's compliment <br>
> -> How to find 2's compliment of a binary number?<br>
> -> Why we use 2's compliment form to store a negative number?<br>
> dataTypes.cpp<br>

#### While Loop
##### Syntax of while loop
> Solution -> whileLoop.cpp
##### Print all the odd numbers from  2 to N, where N will be given by the user.
> Solution -> oddNumbers.cpp
##### Check if a number N is prime or composite, where N will be given by the user.
> Solution -> primeNumber.cpp

---

#### For Loop
##### Syntax of for loop
> Solution -> forLoop.cpp
##### Print all the even numbers from  2 to N, where N will be given by the user.
> Practice problem similar to oddNumbers.cpp

---

#### Patterns
##### Print a pattern as given below (Everytime N will be given by the user)
```
N = 5

* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
```
> Solution -> pattern1.cpp

##### Print a pattern as given below for a number N (Everytime N will be given by the user)
```
N = 5

1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5 
```
> Solution -> pattern2.cpp

##### Print a pattern as given below for a number N (Everytime N will be given by the user)
```
N = 5

1 
2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 10 
11 12 13 14 15
```
> Solution -> pattern3.cpp

##### Print a pattern as given below for a number N (Everytime N will be given by the user)
```
N = 5

1 
0 1 
1 0 1 
0 1 0 1 
1 0 1 0 1 
```
> Solution -> pattern4.cpp

##### Print a pattern as given below for a number N (Everytime N will be given by the user)
```
N = 5

        * 
      * * * 
    * * * * * 
  * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * *  
```
> Solution -> pattern5.cpp

##### Print a pattern as given below for a number N (Everytime N will be given by the user)
```
N = 5

        * 
      * * * 
    * * * * * 
  * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * 
  * * * * * * * 
    * * * * * 
      * * * 
        * 
```
> Solution -> pattern6.cpp
